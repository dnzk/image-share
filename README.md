image-share
===========

Image share app, a standalone app to share image on facebook.

Prerequisites:

You need these to be able to run this app:
<ul>
  <li>Node.js and npm (I don't think I have to put extensive explanation about how to do it here).</li>
  <li>Grunt-CLI (npm install -g grunt-cli)</li>
  <li>Bower (npm install -g bower)</li>
</ul>

Once you have those installed, assuming you've cloned this project, now install the dependencies from the command line:

  bower install
  npm install

To run the server that serves the app:

  grunt
  
<i>Yes, please have yourself located in the app's directory before you run the installation and the app runner itself.</i>
